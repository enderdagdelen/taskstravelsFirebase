This is a web app for companies to track their employees actions.
-Daiy activities: Employees fill in what they do, which project they are working on daily or at the end of the week.
-Tasks outside the company. If employee has a meeting outside the company, he or she could fill a form about where he is going, when return and with whom to meet etc.
-Overday tasks-travels. If employee needs to leave the company or even the cÄ±ty for more then 1 day, employee sould fill in a form about where he is going, for which project he*she needs to go, reason, how long the travel will be etc
-Employee doesn't need to type overtime. App calculates how much overtime an employee worked according to the holiday dates it has for each year. So if the employee leaves the irm for 40 days, maybe going to visit the construction or such, he/she just needs to type in the dates and times of departure and arrival. App calculates all according to the labor law.(labor law of Turkey for now but will be enhanced accordingly)
